# Remote sensing data

## Summary
<h3>Data Correction</h3>
Remote Sensing data are usually not ready to use, due to many reasons such as errors from sensor devices and cloud covering. Therefore, it is needed to correct before using. There are many corrections techniques as following:

Correction|Solutions
------|:-------
1. Geometric correction<br>![](images/3 - Geometric correction.png)|**Correction Techniques:** Backward mapping (Linear Regression), Resampling <br><br> **Explanation:** Remotely sensed image distortions can be happened due to view angle, topography or wind. Therefore, we may use GCP (Ground control points) with polynomial function to correct
2. Atmospheric Correction<br>![](images/3 - Atmospheric Correction.png)|**Correction Techniques:** Dark object subtraction (DOS), Psuedo-invariant Features (PIFs)<br><br> **Explanation:** Absorption and scattering may reduces contrast of image and cause adjacency effect, which is the situation when radiance from pixels nearby is mixed into pixel of interest. <br>One of the solutions is to apply Dark object subtraction (DOS) by searching each band for the darkest value then subtracts that from each pixel.<br> The other method is Psuedo-invariant Features (PIFs), which is to adjust the image based on the regression result.
3. Orthorectification correction<br>![](images/3 - Orthorectification correction.png)|**Correction Techniques:** Cosine correction <br><br>**Explanation:** According to the image, the street looks curve, even if the reality is the straight street. Therefore, cosine correction can be applied to remove distortions and making the pixels viewed at nadir (straight down).

<h3>Technical Terms</h3>
Term|Definition
----|:---------
Digital number (DN)|Intensity of the electromagnetic radiation per pixel
Radiance|How much light the instrument sees in meaningful units
Reflectance|the ratio of light leaving the target to amount striking the target.
TOA reflectance|Measure radiation going down and up in a ring
Surface reflectance|Measure radiation going down
hemispherical reflectance|All of the light leaving the surface goes straight to the sensor
