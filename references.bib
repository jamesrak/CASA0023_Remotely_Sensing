	abstract = {[Remote Sensing (RS) refers to the science of identification of earth surface features and estimation of their geo-biophysical properties using electromagnetic radiation as a medium of interaction. Spectral, spatial, temporal and polarization signatures are major characteristics of the sensor/target, which facilitate target discrimination. Earth surface data as seen by the sensors in different wavelengths (reflected, scattered and/or emitted) is radiometrically and geometrically corrected before extraction of spectral information. RS data, with its ability for a synoptic view, repetitive coverage with calibrated sensors to detect changes, observations at different resolutions, provides a better alternative for natural resources management as compared to traditional methods. Indian Earth Observation (EO) programme has been applications-driven and national development has been its prime motivation. From Bhaskara to Cartosat, India's EO capability has increased manifold. Improvements are not only in spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolutions, but also in their coverage and value-added products. Some of the major operational application themes, in which India has extensively used remote sensing data are agriculture, forestry, water resources, land use, urban sprawl, geology, environment, coastal zone, marine resources, snow and glacier, disaster monitoring and mitigation, infrastructure development, etc. The paper reviews RS techniques and applications carried out using both optical and microwave sensors. It also analyses the gap areas and discusses the future perspectives.]},

	doi = {10.1109/DICTA.2016.7797053},
	abstract = {This paper presents the impact of automatic feature extraction used in a deep learning architecture such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Recently CNN has become a very popular tool for image classification which can automatically extract features, learn and classify them. It is a common belief that CNN can always perform better than other well-known classifiers. However, there is no systematic study which shows that automatic feature extraction in CNN is any better than other simple feature extraction techniques, and there is no study which shows that other simple neural network architectures cannot achieve same accuracy as CNN. In this paper, a systematic study to investigate CNN's feature extraction is presented. CNN with automatic feature extraction is firstly evaluated on a number of benchmark datasets and then a simple traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with full image, and manual feature extraction are evaluated on the same benchmark datasets. The purpose is to see whether feature extraction in CNN performs any better than a simple feature with MLP and full image with MLP. Many experiments were systematically conducted by varying number of epochs and hidden neurons. The experimental results revealed that traditional MLP with suitable parameters can perform as good as CNN or better in certain cases.},

	abstract = {Detailed information about seismic building structural types (SBSTs) is crucial for accurate earthquake vulnerability and risk modeling as it reflects the main load-bearing structures of buildings and, thus, the behavior under seismic load. However, for numerous urban areas in earthquake prone regions this information is mostly outdated, unavailable, or simply not existent. To this purpose, we present an effective approach to estimate SBSTs by combining scarce in situ observations, multi-sensor remote sensing data and machine learning techniques. In particular, an approach is introduced, which deploys a sequential procedure comprising five main steps, namely calculation of features from remote sensing data, feature selection, outlier detection, generation of synthetic samples, and supervised classification under consideration of both Support Vector Machines and Random Forests. Experimental results obtained for a representative study area, including large parts of the city of Padang (Indonesia), assess the capabilities of the presented approach and confirm its great potential for a reliable area-wide estimation of SBSTs and an effective earthquake loss modeling based on remote sensing, which should be further explored in future research activities.},

This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and random forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.},

However, there are few algorithms that output a desired number of regular, compact superpixels with a low computational overhead. We introduce a novel algorithm that clusters pixels in the combined five-dimensional color and image plane space to efficiently generate compact, nearly uniform superpixels. The simplicity of our approach makes it extremely easy to use -- a lone parameter specifies the number of superpixels -- and the efficiency of the algorithm makes it very practical. Experiments show that our approach produces superpixels at a lower computational cost while achieving a segmentation quality equal to or greater than four state-of-the-art methods, as measured by boundary recall and under-segmentation error. We also demonstrate the benefits of our superpixel approach in contrast to existing methods for two tasks in which superpixels have already been shown to increase performance over pixel-based methods},

In developing countries, rapid industrialization and urbanization imposes a major threat to natural environment. Present study was carried out to monitor the LULC changes due to urbanization in a rapidly changing river basin, India. The purpose of choosing the river basin was to analyze past changes and predict possible consequences within a defined natural boundary. Multi-temporal images acquired from Landsat and Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites between 1992–2009 as well as a digital elevation model was used to generate historical and current LULC pattern in the basin. An object based image analysis technique was employed for precise classification of multi-temporal images followed by GIS-based change detection studies. The study reveals that the built up area has increased significantly and added 288 km2 between 1992–2009. Increase in built up area is attributed to decrease in wastelands and agricultural land. The expansion of built up area along major transportation networks, specifically after the year 2000 shows the rapid rate of urbanization in the basin.},

	abstract = {Urban land use information is essential for a variety of urban-related applications such as urban planning and regional administration. The extraction of urban land use from very fine spatial resolution (VFSR) remotely sensed imagery has, therefore, drawn much attention in the remote sensing community. Nevertheless, classifying urban land use from VFSR images remains a challenging task, due to the extreme difficulties in differentiating complex spatial patterns to derive high-level semantic labels. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer great potential to extract high-level spatial features, thanks to its hierarchical nature with multiple levels of abstraction. However, blurred object boundaries and geometric distortion, as well as huge computational redundancy, severely restrict the potential application of CNN for the classification of urban land use. In this paper, a novel object-based convolutional neural network (OCNN) is proposed for urban land use classification using VFSR images. Rather than Pixel-wise convolutional processes, the OCNN relies on segmented objects as its functional units, and CNN networks are used to analyse and label objects such as to partition within-object and between-object variation. Two CNN networks with different model structures and window sizes are developed to predict linearly shaped objects (e.g. Highway, Canal) and general (other non-linearly shaped) objects. Then a rule-based decision fusion is performed to integrate the class-specific classification results. The effectiveness of the proposed OCNN method was tested on aerial photography of two large urban scenes in Southampton and Manchester in Great Britain. The OCNN combined with large and small window sizes achieved excellent classification accuracy and computational efficiency, consistently outperforming its sub-modules, as well as other benchmark comparators, including the Pixel-wise CNN, contextual-based MRF and object-based OBIA-SVM methods. The proposed method provides the first object-based CNN framework to effectively and efficiently address the complicated problem of urban land use classification from VFSR images.},

Egypt has a strategic direction in expanding agricultural areas, which highlights the objective of the research that is to assess soil fertility through its geographical assessment and remote sensing. The examination region of this investigation is situated in north region of west desert, about 55 km, west of Cairo, Egypt. A semi-detail survey was carried out using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) for the study. The results found the high suitable areas (S1) for field crops; barley and wheat were about 54.7\% for each of the total area, while for corn and beans were about 44.9\% for each of the total area, while S1 areas for vegetable crops; tomato, eggplant, and melon were 67.8, 71.2, and 53.2\% of the total area, respectively, while S2 for pepper–zucchini was about 65.4 and 49.7\% of the total area, respectively. But for fruit trees, S1 is for pears (60.3\%), pomegranates (50.9\%), and palms (80.2\%) while S2 for olives (30.3\%), Figs. (30.3\%), almonds (10.4\%), vines (19.7\%), and peaches (20.5\%). To reduce water losses is by improving the means of delivery and raising the efficiency of irrigation, by evaluating the appropriate situation of the irrigation system for soil quality in the study area, and by choosing the appropriate methods of irrigation in the region to raise efficiency in rationalizing consumption and reducing losses. Drip and sprinkle irrigation suitability for the entire area are moderate to high, where soil texture factor is limiting drip irrigation method while wind speed and soil texture factors are limiting sprinkle irrigation in the area.},
