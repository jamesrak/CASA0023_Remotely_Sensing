# An Introduction to Remote Sensing

1.  Sensor

    1.   Passive

        1.  Use energy that is available

        2.  Usually detecting reflected energy from the sun

        3.  e.g. Human eye, camera, satellite sensor

    2.  Active

        1.  Have an energy source for illumination

        2.  See through clouds

        3.  e.g. Radar, X-ray, LiDAR

2.  Electromagnetic waves

    1.  Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) = Wave carry energy over time

    2.  Energy carried by EMR waves = radiant energy

    3.  Energy per unit of time = radiant flux

    4.  Energy from the sun = incoming shortwave radiation or shortwave radiation

    5.  Atmospheric Correction;

        1.  to remove atmosphere like cloud

        2.  Big issue to deal with

            1.  Programming; detect cloud and estimate by other pictures

            2.  Using active sensors like Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to see through clouds, but the issue is about the accuracy of the outputs

                1.  emit the signal by polarization (single/dual)

                2.  HH = emitted in horizontal (H) and received in horizontal (H)

    6.  Color

        1.  Sky is blue; Sunlight is scattered by small wavelengths

        2.  Moon sky is black; no atmosphere

        3.  Ocean is blue; water absorb wavelength

3.  Data

    1.  Format - Raster

        1.  common file types: BIL, BSQ, BIP, GeoTIFF

    2.  Resolutions

        1.  Spatial: range between 10 cm and several km

            1.  (e.g. 20cm or 30m)

        2.  Spectral: the number of bands it records data

            1.  spectral signature - creating from values for each wavelength across the electromagnetic spectrum

        3.  Temporal = the time it revisits

            1.  e.g. daily, every 7 days, on demand

        4.  Radiometric = identify differences in light or reflectance

            1.  e.g an 8 bit sensor has values between 0 and 255 (256 possible values), an 11 bit sensor has values between 0 and 2047

    3.  Color

        1.  True color: human can see e.g. red, blue, green

        2.  False color: including many bands human can\'t see

    4.  Satellite imagery

        1.  MODIS - 500 m

        2.  Landsat - 30 cm
